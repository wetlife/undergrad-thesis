* mask images
** ask user for base directory and string to match filenames of the images(*.tif, probably) 
** if there are matching filenames in the base directory:
*** read images
*** have user create mask
*** get user user confirmation by showing the mask applied to all images
*** save masked images to the output folder(predetermined folder)
** repeat these substeps for all subfolders in the base directory
* use regionprops to find the total area for each segmented image
* create a csv for each experiment in a single location:
** record the time since trypsin, area, and aspect ratio for each image
* plot d(area)/d(time) and d(aspect ratio)/d(time) for all experiments together
