% run segmenter with various brightness factors

% calulate mean values of area and eccentricity for each object

% for each brightness factor:

    % create central text file named to identify each object

    % record variance of area for each object in central object text file

    % record variance of eccentricity for each object in central object text file

    % record in central text file for all objects the sum of each object's
    
% create sorted list of most acceptable brightness factors
