% run segmenter with various brightness factors

% calulate mean values of area and eccentricity for each object

% for each brightness factor:

    % create text file named to identify each data set

    % record variance of area for each data set

    % record variance of eccentricity for each data set

    % sum variances and place in a central list for all data sets
    
% create sorted list of most acceptable brightness factors
